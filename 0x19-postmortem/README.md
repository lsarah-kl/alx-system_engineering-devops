Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: December 3, 2023, 10:30 AM (PST)
End Time: December 3, 2023, 12:45 PM (PST)

Impact:
Our service took an unscheduled coffee break for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.
Users experienced a brief pause in their daily routine, with a 45% disruption in service for active users.

Root Cause:
The culprit behind the curtain was a mischievous firewall rule update that played a game of hide-and-seek, blocking critical server communication ports.

Timeline:

Issue Detection:
Our automated monitoring systems yelled, "Houston, we have a problem!" at 10:30 AM (PST) with a sudden spike in failed server health checks.

Actions Taken:
Initially thought our servers were just camera-shy due to increased traffic.
Investigated server logs and discovered weird network patterns.
We pursued a database bottleneck theory but quickly realized the real troublemaker was the firewall.
The cavalry arrived in the form of the DevOps and Infrastructure teams.

Resolution:
Put an end to the game by reverting the firewall's antics at 12:45 PM (PST), restoring harmony among our servers.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
A misconfigured firewall rule thought it would be funny to block critical server communication ports, causing our service to go MIA.

Resolution:
We calmly told the firewall to stop playing games and reverted to its last-known good behavior, ensuring our servers could talk to each other again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Our change management processes are getting a makeover to avoid misconfigurations during routine updates.
We're providing our monitoring systems with binoculars to spot any more sneaky firewall rule changes.

Tasks to Address:
Implement stricter change control policies and ensure the firewall follows the rules.
Conduct regular firewall rule check-ups to prevent any future hide-and-seek tournaments.
Enhance monitoring systems to scream louder when the firewall decides to misbehave.

Conclusion:
Our unexpected service break was the result of a rogue firewall rule update playing hide-and-seek with our server communication ports. We swiftly identified and put an end to the mischief, promising to keep a closer eye on our firewalls and their rulebook.
